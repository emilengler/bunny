## About

*Bunny* is a toy implementation of Rosenpass written in the Elixir programming language.
It is written from scratch for the purpose of teaching myself the Rosenpass protocol in each and every aspect.
Because this is a toy project of an cryptographic application, users should *cautions* in using this.
If you really want to achieve a post-quantum WireGuard tunnel, I strongly recommend going with the [reference implementation](https://github.com/rosenpass/rosenpass).
